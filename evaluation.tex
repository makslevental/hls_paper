We evaluate our design methodology, as applied to BraggNN, and a few NN functional units, against ScaleHLS\cite{ye2021scalehls} and SODA-OPT\cite{9516615}, two state-of-the-art but general purpose DNN compiler to HLS tool flows.
Both tools perform design space exploration but at the cost of high-runtimes and ultimately inferior results \emph{when latency is the only metric}.
