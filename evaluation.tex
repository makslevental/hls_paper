We evaluate our design methodology, as applied to BraggNN, and a few NN functional units, against \commnt{\url{https://github.com/hanchenye/scalehls https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.11673}}{ScaleHLS} and \commnt{\url{https://gitlab.pnnl.gov/sodalite/soda-opt https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9516615}}{SODA-OPT}, two state-of-the-art but general purpose DNN compiler to HLS tool flows.
Both tools perform design space exploration but at the cost of high-runtimes and ultimately inferior results \emph{when latency is the only metric}.
